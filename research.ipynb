      "**FUNCTIONAL DESIGN**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **User Registration**: The system will provide a registration form where users can enter their email and a secure password. After form submission, a verification email will be sent to the provided email, and after successful verification, the user account will be activated.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **User Login**: Users should be able to log into the system using their registered email and password. Upon successful authentication, they'll be redirected to their account dashboard.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Admin User Management**: Administrators can access a page listing all registered users. This functional requirement will include user details like email, registration date, and account status.\n",
      "\n",
      "**TECHNICAL DESIGN**\n",
      "\n",
      "The system will be constructed using the following technology stack:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Frontend**: Angular - A JavaScript-based open-source front-end web application framework.\n",
      "- **Backend**: Node.js – An open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment. For seamless interaction between the backend and frontend, we'll use RESTful APIs.\n",
      "- **Database**: MongoDB - A source-available cross-platform document-oriented database to store user data.\n",
      "- **Authentication Service**: JWT (JSON Web Token) - A proposed Internet standard for creating data with optional signature and/or optional encryption whose payload holds JSON.\n",
      "\n",
      "**FRONTEND**\n",
      "\n",
      "The frontend application built with Angular provides user-friendly forms for user registration and login. It communicates with the backend through RESTful APIs to send or retrieve data.\n",
      "\n",
      "**BACKEND**\n",
      "\n",
      "The backend, built with Node.js, provides RESTful APIs for frontend interaction. It accepts and processes requests from frontend, interacts with the database, and handles user authentication using JWT Tokens.\n",
      "\n",
      "**DATABASE**\n",
      "\n",
      "MongoDB database stores user email, hashes of passwords and any other user related information. We use hashes for password to ensure security.\n",
      "\n",
      "**AUTHENTICATION SERVICE**\n",
      "\n",
      "When a user logs in, the service authenticates users by their email and password, then generates a JWT. This token is sent to client and needs to be included for each subsequent request as a verification of user's authenticity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**DATA FLOW**\n",
      "\n",
      "The data flow happens mainly through RESTful APIs between the client and server. For example, when users log in, their data is sent to the backend through an API, validated, and a JWT is returned on success. This JWT is then required to access other API endpoints.\n",
      "\n",
      "**ADMIN MANAGEMENT**\n",
      "\n",
      "Admins have a separate interface. They log in similarly, but they are directed to an admin panel where they can view a complete list of registered users retrieved from a specific API. An authenticated admin can also perform other tasks such as approval, deletion, or updating user details.\n",
